# Pomodoro Together Web frontend

A social pomodoro app for productivity. Create Pomodoro sessions which friends can join to use as a synchronized work timer. This app is focused on minimalism and robustness.

This is a WIP app, I will continue to develop this app when I have the time/motivation. It's currently an MVP with most functionality implemented, but not very styled or customizable.
